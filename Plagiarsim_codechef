***
You are an administrator of a popular quiz website.
Every day, you hold a quiz on the website.
There are N users (numbered 1 through N) and M admins (numbered N+1 through N+M). For each quiz, each user is allowed to attempt it at most once. 
Sometimes, admins attempt the quizzes for testing purposes too; an admin may attempt a quiz any number of times.
On a certain day, the quiz was attempted K times. For each i (1≤i≤K), the i-th of these attempts was made by the person with number Li. 
Find all the users who attempted the quiz more than once, in order to disqualify them.
