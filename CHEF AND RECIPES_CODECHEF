****
Chef was given a task where he has a sequence of N recipes.
Each recipe has a goodness score which is given by 4i+1 (0â‰¤i<N). Chef will like this sequence of recipes if all of them have the same goodness score. 
Chef is allowed to do below operation any number of times to make goodness of all recipes equal .
In one operation, Chef can select any two recipes X and Y and then subtract 1 from Recipe X and add 1 to Recipe Y. 
He has to make the goodness score of all the recipes equal using some operations. 
Since the Chef is busy in preparing food, help him find the minimum numbers of operations needed to make the goodness of all recipes equal.
