There is a grid of size 105×105, covered completely in railway tracks. 
Tom is riding in a train, currently in cell (a,b), and Jerry is tied up in a different cell (c,d), unable to move. 
The train has no breaks. It shall move exactly K steps, and then its fuel will run out and it shall stop.
In one step, the train must move to one of its neighboring cells, sharing a side. 
Tom can’t move without the train, as the grid is covered in tracks. Can Tom reach Jerry’s cell after exactly K steps?
Note: Tom can go back to the same cell multiple times.

	    if(k>=dist){
