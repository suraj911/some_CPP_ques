The King of Wales was very busy because of some work and he could not give much time to his Queen, because of which she is very angry. 
To make her happy the king decided to make a necklace of pearls for her. The king buys an array A of n pearls where the i-th element represents the type of pearl. 
Since he loves her alot , he knows that she will like the Necklace only if each type of pearl is present in the Necklace in a unique quantity.
Can you tell if the queen will like the Necklace.
