***
Chef is a very lazy person. Whatever work is supposed to be finished in x units of time, he finishes it in m∗x units of time. 
But there is always a limit to laziness, so he delays the work by at max d units of time.
Given x,m,d, find the maximum time taken by Chef to complete the work.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t;cin>>t;
	while(t--){
	    int x,m,d;
	    cin>>x>>m>>d;
	    int k = (x*m) > (x+d) ? (x+d) : (x*m);
	    cout<<k<<"\n";
	}
	return 0;
}
